Header files contain templates for members' classes of expeditions,
some using specialized templates and various concepts
as well as a Treasure class. Adventurers can meet
one another on the road, so in treasure_hunt.h template
Encounter simulates such meetings. Using constant 
expressions allows this program to be done fully during
compilation time.
